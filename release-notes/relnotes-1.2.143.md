It has a title and article content, which is suitable for help articles.

## Page block for displaying a roadmap

To get a living, up-to-date product roadmap instead of a static, presentation-only one, we've created a new page block in this release.

As we are able to change the data of any page blocks in Document Node including this roadmap page block, it's no-brainer to keep your roadmap up-to-date.
