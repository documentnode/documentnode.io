Choose a target device, a layout, and set margins, you will get your PDF files immediately. Next time when you want to quickly export a PDF file with the same settings, just press `Command + Shift + S` on macOS (`Ctrl + Shift + S` on Windows and Linux), and then press `Enter` key. It will be done within one second.

In the `Save as PDF` settings dialogue, if you select `Mobile` devices and the total number of pages is less than 20, it will be generated as a single page PDF file, which will be very good for reading on mobile devices.

## Quicker to Rename Files

From time to time, we want to rename a Markdown file to the first heading we write in the text editor or the first dozens of characters of the document content.

This new version can calculate a suggested new file name and put it into the text box automatically, to avoid typing manually.

Press `F2` key to show the `Rename` dialogue, and then press the Enter key, you can rename a file within two seconds.

## Improved the Login Dialogue

To make it easier for new users to log in quickly, we integrated the most popular third-party authentication providers in the software.
