# Version 1.3.18 (stable)

## Progress Message Popup

Previously, the progress message bar is shown on the bottom right status bar, which is not apparent to new users. They may not notice what is happening after clicking the "Run" button.

To eliminate the confusion, we added a progress message popup that shows in the centre of the main window.

It can be hidden when we click the "Minimize" button on the top right corner.

## New 'Save As' Icon in Text Editor

In Document Node, you can save the current document as a PDF/HTML/picture file, and you can also export the current project as PDF/HTML files or a website.

In this version, we added a new 'Save As' icon on the top right corner of the text editor, so it will be easier to access the 'Save As' functionalities.
