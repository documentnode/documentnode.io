# Version 1.3.19 (stable)

Today's release is a minor version that makes the current version more stable. It only contains several improvements and fixes. Please see the details below.

The next major release is under development and will be available in a few months.

## Renamed 'Run' Menu to 'Website'

In Document Node, a website can be generated from a documents folder automatically, which was called 'Run' a project.

To make it more straightforward, we renamed the menu to 'Website', and sub-menu items to 'Launch Website', 'Open Website' (if already launched), and 'Stop Website' accordingly.
