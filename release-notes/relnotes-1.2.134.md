# Version 1.2.134 (beta)

## Improvements for page block data editors

We redesigned the page block data editors so that they can be extendable. It will unleash the power of flexibly creating tons of more page blocks.

In the meantime, we improved the image editor with a new thumbnail preview,

and implemented a new data editor for the "Team Members" page block.

## New 'Browsing Mode' toolbar button

In addition to pressing the `ESC` key to switch back to the normal browsing mode, we added a new `Browsing Mode` button to the site builder toolbar.
