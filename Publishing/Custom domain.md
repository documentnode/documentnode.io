# Custom domain

#Site/Publishing
For the custom domain to work with Document Node hosting, please add the following DNS record with your domain registrar: 

|  Type  |  Name  |  Value |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
|  CNAME  | *[you custom domain]* | hosting.documentnode.io |

If you would like to configure your naked domain name to point to Document Node hosting, please contact us at support@documentnode.io and we will let you know how to configure a DNS A record.

It may take up to 24 hours to take effect. You can continue publishing using the subdomain.
